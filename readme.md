# K-Means Clustering
This program uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to group a list of numbers into a specified number of clusters.

## How to Use
### Install the required dependencies: 
+ numpy `pip install numpy`
# Run the program
The program will ask the user for the required number of iterations `N`
The program will generate a list of 300 random integers between 1 and 100000
The program will then group the numbers into 5 clusters (by default, you can change this number by modifying the k variable)
The program will output the selected centroids and the final centroids with their corresponding cluster label
The program will ask if you want to see the clusters. If you enter 'y', it will display the clusters and wait for you to press enter to exit. If you enter `n`, it will exit immediately.
Note: The program will stop running after `N` number of iterations or when the centroids have converged.
